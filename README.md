# Lifebot
This is a simple chatbot which would solve some basic queries about enviornment.
This is a classical style chatbot where instead of using Machine Learning, we try to find different common words in the question and link answers related to that.
I also added a GUI for the same
ans.txt and ques.txt are files which would contain the answers and questions respectively.
I just searched these question and collected their answers from google, gemini, and chatgpt

This code will be using tkinter to use a GUI. Make sure to have it installed/updated
